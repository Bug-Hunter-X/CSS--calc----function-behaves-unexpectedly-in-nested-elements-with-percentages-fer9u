The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected when used with percentages within nested elements.  For example, consider the following:

```css
.container {
  width: 50%;
}

.inner {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
}
```

If the `.container`'s width is calculated based on its parent's width, the `calc()` function inside `.inner` might not calculate correctly if the parent's width isn't finalized yet. This can happen during the rendering process, leading to unexpected results where the `.inner` element has an incorrect width.
